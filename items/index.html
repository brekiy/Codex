  <h1>Items</h1>
    <p>Player characters and non-player characters alike carry a variety of items, suited for their daily lives. Clothes, armor, food, rope, camping gear, matchsticks - the list goes on and on. You can select a category and view a table containing its items on its own page.</p>
    <!--TODO: it would be cool to dynamically populate a table via javascript!
        probably have to generate a json first of each table, and then have some filler table here. once the user 
        clicks on a button, a script will pull the items, expand/shrink the table as necessary, and fill the stuff. 
        may or not be possible, but i think it is-->
