	<h1>Ketol</h1>
	<h2>Medium Sapient</h2>
	<h2>Playable Species</h2>
	<p>The ketolir are almost as old as the goblins. They were changed from molten stone to flesh and given souls by the Burned God, whose true name was lost to time. To stay his wrath, they make sacrifices of livestock and on occasion their own blood.</p>
	<p>They make their homes in various mountain ranges, carving out the insides and turning them into fortresses. Inside, they are compulsive miners, delving ever deeper, closer to the magma of the world from which they were shaped. In doing so they have learned to process and refine metal and jewels, becoming renowned smiths and jewelers.</p>
	<p>In the old days, they were in constant conflict with goblins as they expanded, as well as other underground life such as troglodytes. Most, if not all, ketol fortresses practice universal conscription as soon as potential soldiers come of age. Young conscripts see this as doing a great duty, and indeed the military is one of the ways for the lower classes to move up the social ladder. Once humans met them, they thought they were simple humans with dwarfism, and the name stuck in Common once they started calling them dwarves.</p>
