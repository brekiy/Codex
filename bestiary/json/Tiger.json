    "A large cat, with dark vertical stripes on red-orange fur. They are found in on Lethinil, in climates ranging from humid jungle to the cold tundra. Some view them as dangers to their livestock and try to exterminate them. The fidazim hold them to be a holy animal and so come into conflict with human tiger hunters often."
