    "Fidazim are elves that were left on the continent during the First Cataclysm and returned to a relatively primitive state, worshipping the old god Neretho the World Shaper. The majority live within nomadic tribes found in Daesca and Lethinil, although some have found work as explorers and scouts in human towns.",
    "One of Neretho\u2019s tenets is to not harm vegetation. This has made them incredibly carnivorous, and their hunters are nearly unparalleled with bow and javelin. They wear leather tanned with minerals, and use bones, dead wood, and sinews to make their weapons. When humans began interacting with them, they traded pelts for metal weapons."
