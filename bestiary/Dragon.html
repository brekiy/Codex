	<h1>Dragon</h1>
	<h2>Gigantic Legendary</h2>
	<p>A large, winged magical ancestor of lizards. Dragons are fiercely territorial, are known to speak to sapients in multiple languages, are big enough to swallow a cow whole and strong enough to destroy a sturdy log cabin simply by smashing into it. They are covered in tough scales that bold hunters covet and turn into protective armor, although very few hunters are successful.</p>

	<h2>Attacks</h2>
	<p><b>Can use techniques:</b> False</p>
	<p><b>Breathe Fire</b> (AP Cost: 12) [Damage: 6d10 Fire]</p>
	<p>The dragon breathes fire in a 12m long straight line. When a creature is caught in the fire it can make a DC10 Acrobatics check to take half of the damage. The creature also gains the Burning status effect for 5 turns.</p>
	<p><b>Bite</b> (AP Cost: 8) [Damage: 5d12 Rending]</p>
	<p>The dragon bites one target adjacent to it. It can pay 2 more AP per round to hold it in its jaws until the dragon takes damage, dropping the creature. Additionally, it can pay 2 more AP to throw the creature, which travels 1d12 x 2m, taking 1d6 Crushing damage for every 2m traveled.</p>
	<p><b>Tail Swipe</b> (AP Cost: 12) [Damage: 5d10 Crushing]</p>
	<p>The dragon swipes at an arc of 3 tiles within 4m of it using its tail. Creatures hit by the sweep fall prone and are knocked back 2m.</p>
	<p><b>Body Slam</b> (AP Cost: 16) [Damage: 10d10 Crushing]</p>
	<p>The dragon can forcefully land if in the air, crushing all targets beneath it.</p>
	<h2>Traits</h2>
	<p><b>Dragonhide</b> <p>Dragons take half damage from all sources.</p>
	<p><b>Frightening Presence</b> <p>Whenever a dragon flies or breathes fire, all creatures within 60m that can see it must make a SPR check or gain the Afraid status effect for 1d4 turns.</p>
	<p><b>Poisonous Blood</b> <p>A dragon's blood is a very potent toxin that can be absorbed through the skin. A couple of drops relaxes and numbs the area, making a good painkiller, but a small vial's worth, like the kind sold at an alchemist's shop, will kill any human. Dragon hunters fighting it in melee commonly wear full-face helmets to protect against splashing blood. Whenever a dragon is harmed in melee, make a DC5 (or DC1 if you are wearing full-body armor and some sort of face mask - doesn't need to be metal) AGI check or take 2d10 damage.</p>
