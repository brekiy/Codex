	<h1>Dragon</h1>
	<h2>Gigantic Legendary</h2>
	<p>A gigantic, magical, flying creature that distantly resembles lizards. Dragons possess immense strength and the ability to breathe fire, and are covered in a tough hide of scales. On top of this, they have a mind to rival any mortal scholar, and were among the first creatures to walk the earth, having been created by Neretho the World-Shaper. They refer to themselves as the "Firstborn", and are extremely proud of this fact.</p>

	<h2>Attacks</h2>
	<p><b>Can use techniques:</b> False</p>
	<p><b>Breathe Fire</b> (AP Cost: 12) [Damage: 6d10 Fire]</p>
	<p>The dragon breathes fire in a 12m long straight line, forcing targets to make a DC12 Acrobatics or Athletics check. On a failure, it takes the full listed damage, and half as much on a success. The creature also gains the Burning status effect.</p>
	<p><b>Bite</b> (AP Cost: 8) [Damage: 5d12 Rending]</p>
	<p>The dragon bites one target adjacent to it. If it succeeds, it can pay 2 more AP to throw the target, which travels 1d12 x 2m and takes 1d4 Crushing damage for every 2m it flies. </p>
	<p><b>Tail Swipe</b> (AP Cost: 12) [Damage: 5d10 Crushing]</p>
	<p>The dragon swipes at an arc of 3 tiles within 6m of it using its tail. Targets hit by the sweep fall prone and are knocked in the direction of the sweep 1d12 x 2m, taking 1d4 Crushing damage for every 2m they travel.</p>
	<p><b>Body Slam</b> (AP Cost: 16) [Damage: 10d10 Crushing]</p>
	<p>The dragon forcefully lands if in the air, crushing all targets beneath it.</p>
	<h2>Traits</h2>
	<p>Dragonhide - Dragons have damage resistance from all sources.
	<p>Frightening Presence - Whenever a dragon flies or breathes fire, all creatures within 60m that can see it must make a SPR check or gain the Afraid status effect for 1d4 turns.
	<p>Poisonous Blood - Dragon blood is a very potent toxin that can be absorbed through the skin. A few drops relax and nunmb the area, making a good painkiller, but a small vial's worth, like the kind sold at an alchemist's shop, will kill any tiger or bear easily. Whenever you harm a dragon in melee, roll 1d20. On a roll of 3 or lower, you are splashed with dragon blood and must make a DC15 FOR check. On a failure, take 2d10 damage, or half that on a success. If wearing heavy armor, you must instead roll 2 or lower to be splashed.
	<h2>Perks</h2>
	<p>Language - All, Death Blow 2, Tough</p>
