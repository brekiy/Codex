	<h1>Leshy</h1>
	<h2>Medium Legendary</h2>
	<p>A curious shapeshifting creature that vaguely resembles a walking tree, with a twisted face that betrays its malevolent intent. It can extend its limbs to attack targets from afar, and is only found in forests, where it preys on woodsmen and unfortunate campers. Leshyn are bold and will happily attack groups of people no matter their size.</p>
