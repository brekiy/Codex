    "The aelvezim are one of the oldest sentient races in the known world. In times past they ruled an empire that stretched from coast to coast. After the Second Cataclysm, they took to the skies in floating magical cities and isolated themselves from the world.",
    "They are the only race that has any sort of magic in abundance but are inexperienced with the current world. They worship a pantheon of four deities:",
    "Celdor the Thunderer, King of the Gods and the Sky",
    "Haerme the Silver, She Who Watches",
    "Yulma the Trickster",
    "Mereth the Deadlord",
    "The majority simply worship Celdor, for he is the supreme deity. Warriors revere Celdor for his strength, and Yulma for her cunning. Wizards worship Herme as she is the one who blessed them with magic. Mereth, as the death god, is more feared than worshipped.",
    "Humans coined the terms \"elf\" and \"elves\" in Common."
