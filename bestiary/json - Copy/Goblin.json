    "These cave-dwellers have existed for as long as the first myths. In the depths, clans carve out rough caves where they sleep, eat and live out their short, brutal lives. Their society is quite lawless. Clan leaders are almost always the result of meritocracy: they forced their way into the position by being stronger or smarter than the last one, or both. They are the only ones in the clan to get private chambers, with the others gathered in smaller sub-caves connected to the main cavern.",
    "Fighting with dwarves and each other is constant as they scramble for resources. They forage and steal for food and usually scramble about naked or in rags. Though they make use of metal, no clans know how to forge it themselves.",
    "Humans initially thought they were myths cooked up by dwarves, and named them goblins. The dwarves just call them cave trash. They have no special name for themselves, simply referring to each other as members of a clan: \u201cthe hunters from Clan Ghuk\u201d, or \u201ca child from Clan Zaka\u201d, for example.",
    "Some goblins have found themselves on the surface out of curiosity. They are often relegated to the furthest outskirts of society, serving as professional thieves or hitmen for gangs."
