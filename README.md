# Codex

This is a static site I started for two purposes:
1. Host a ruleset for a homebrew pen-and-paper role-playing game.
2. Learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and some Javascript on the way.

TODO:
* Make the character sheet pretty
* Make the website pretty
* Port over entire rulebook from my Google Drive
* ~~Finish Python script to generate the HTML for a creature's page in the bestiary~~
** Spit out the creature as a JSON object
* Other things that seem like a good idea as I think of them
