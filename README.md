# Codex

EDIT MARCH 3 2019:
The old static site has been discontinued and archived on the gh-pages branch. I am migrating the content to a Flask web app which will include user accounts for storing characters and their stat sheets.

This is a static site I started for two purposes:
1. Host a ruleset for a homebrew pen-and-paper role-playing game.
2. Learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and some Javascript on the way.

TODO:
* Make the character sheet pretty
* Make the website pretty
    - I can either find a nice template that I like for static sites, or git gud at CSS
* Port over entire rulebook from my Google Drive
    - Finish writing the background for nations
    - Populate the bestiary with creatures and stat them up
    - Finish perks page
    - Finish items page
* ~~Finish Python script to generate the HTML for a creature's page in the bestiary~~
    - ~~Spit out the creature as a JSON object~~
* Make a Python script to populate the bestiary index with links to each creature's page, because doing it manually sucks
* Make some sort of search bar in the bestiary so users can find creatures by name, category, or size
* Other things that seem like a good idea as I think of them
