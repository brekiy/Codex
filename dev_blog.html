  <p>Started this changelog properly. So far, the site's got:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>About 2/3rds of the core rulebook, not counting any items/perks</li>
      <li>The character sheet content done</li>
      <li>A single table of one-handed weapons for players/NPCs to use</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The site has a pretty 90's feel to it right now, except not a commercial 90's feel, but the academic feel. It's like a university course's website that has the syllabus, down to the bland white background and Time New Roman.</p>
