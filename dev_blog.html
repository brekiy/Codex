    <h2>12-1-2019</h2>
    <p>A bunch of improvements have been made to the character sheet. It no longer lists all the sections at once - users now view one section at a time, preventing information overload. Although it might require more clicks, I think the tradeoff is worth it. In the future I might restore the option to view everything at once.</p>
    <p>A bunch of content updates have also been made to the Items section - notably rounding out the rest of the weapons, armor, and finally including food/drink prices. Regular miscellaneous items still need to be compiled into a list, but that's alright.</p>

    <h2>31-12-2018</h2>
    <p>Last update before 2019 rolls in! I've added a couple of features since the last blog entry:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bestiary with search functionality</li>
      <li>Scaling sidebar of important sections</li>
      <li>Content updates for items</li>
      <li>New font (Cinzel)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8-11-2018</h2>
    <p>Got the dynamic tables up and running on the items page. I think it's pretty project-agnostic, so it could be used
      in other sites without too much modification.</p>
    <p>I've got to change my .csv files into JSON objects, but there are plenty of online converters to do that for me.</p>
    
    <h2>3-11-2018</h2>
    <p>Started this changelog properly. So far, the site's got:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>About 2/3rds of the core rulebook, not counting any items/perks</li>
      <li>The character sheet content done</li>
      <li>A single table of one-handed weapons for players/NPCs to use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The site has a pretty 90's feel to it right now, except not a commercial 90's feel, but the academic feel. It's like
      a university course's website that has the syllabus, down to the bland white background and Times New Roman.</p>
