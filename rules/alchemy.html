<h1>Alchemy</h1>
  <p>Alchemy is the study of combining and manipulating matter. Unlearned peasants might believe that alchemy can turn cow chips to gold, but the most amateurish alchemist will scoff and tell them to find a wizard. Many alchemists are happy to sit in their laboratories and immerse ores in solutions, purify compounds, and brew potent alcohol. The first to start studying alchemy were the dwarves, although since they passed some of its knowledge on to humans, humans have begun to make most of the advancements.</p>
  <p>The dwarves hold that there are six basic alchemical substances: <span style="color:darkorange">Esh</span>, which is dark orange, <span style="color:blue">Dost</span>, which is blue, Gelad, which is dark red, Lokun, which is purple, Kumak, which is green, and Nehwaz, which is dark yellow. When created, they take the form of small, cubic crystals.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Esh:</u> Governs mental strength, grants bonuses to resisting mental stress, casting magic, dealing with the supernatural, etc. A high SPR lets characters shrug off stress that would cripple a lesser being, and in settings with magic a high SPR lets characters cast more spells and commune with supernatural beings more easily.</li>
    <li><u>Dost:</u> Governs awareness of the environment, grants bonuses to observation in/out of combat, etc. A high PER lets characters spot weaknesses and openings in combat, suspicious things in the environment, or help in observing the tells of another character in conversation.</li>
    <li><u>Gelad:</u> Governs coordination/physical movement, grants bonuses to athletics, speed, initiative, etc. A high AGI lets characters react quickly in combat, move easily around the environment and perform acrobatic tricks.</li>
    <li><u>Lokun:</u> Governs physical strength, grants bonuses to physical attacks, heavy lifting, etc. A high MGT lets characters land crushing blows and carry great weights.</li>
    <li><u>Kumak:</u> Governs physical durability, grants bonuses to hit points, physical resistances, etc. A high FOR lets characters shrug off hits that would cripple a lesser being.</li>
    <li><u>Nehwaz:</u> Governs mental aptitude, grants bonuses to skilled work, learning new skills, etc. A high INT lets characters use their natural intuition to help solve problems and learn skills more quickly. In a setting with magic, high INT lets characters master more complex spells.</li>
    <li><u>Charisma (CHR):</u> Governs force of personality, grants bonuses to persuasion, bluffing, socializing, etc. A high CHR lets characters smooth talk their way through many situations, gaining followers or discerning anotherâ€™s motivations/lies.
    </li>
  </ul>
