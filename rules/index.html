<h2>Dice Basics</h2>
  <p>There are a few different types of rolls in this game, but they all boil down to rolling dice and adding multipliers to surpass a <b>Difficulty Class (DC)</b> in some form or another. Since we want to surpass DCs, ties are counted as failures. A natural 1 will always fail, and a natural 20 will always succeed.</p>
  <p>In some cases, you may be granted Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll. Advantage means that you roll two dice, and take the higher roll. Disadvantage means that you take the lower roll instead.</p>
