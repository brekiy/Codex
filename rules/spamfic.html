  <h1>SPAMFIC System</h1>
  <h3>What is SPAMFIC?</h3>
    <p><b>SPAMFIC</b> stands for Spirit, Perception, Agility, Might, Fortitude, Intelligence, Charisma. These are the seven basic stats that all creatures posess.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Spirit (SPR):</u> Governs mental strength, grants bonuses to resisting mental stress, casting magic, dealing with the supernatural, etc. A high SPR lets characters shrug off stress that would cripple a lesser being, and in settings with magic a high SPR lets characters cast more spells and commune with supernatural beings more easily.</li>
      <li><u>Perception (PER):</u> Governs awareness of the environment, grants bonuses to observation in/out of combat, etc. A high PER lets characters spot weaknesses and openings in combat, suspicious things in the environment, or help in observing the tells of another character in conversation.</li>
      <li><u>Agility (AGI):</u> Governs coordination/physical movement, grants bonuses to athletics, speed, initiative, etc. A high AGI lets characters react quickly in combat, move easily around the environment and perform acrobatic tricks.</li>
      <li><u>Might (MGT):</u> Governs physical strength, grants bonuses to physical attacks, heavy lifting, etc. A high MGT lets characters land crushing blows and carry great weights.</li>
      <li><u>Fortitude (FOR):</u> Governs physical durability, grants bonuses to hit points, physical resistances, etc. A high FOR lets characters shrug off hits that would cripple a lesser being.</li>
      <li><u>Intelligence (INT):</u> Governs mental aptitude, grants bonuses to skilled work, learning new skills, etc. A high INT lets characters use their natural intuition to help solve problems and learn skills more quickly. In a setting with magic, high INT lets characters master more complex spells.</li>
      <li><u>Charisma (CHR):</u> Governs force of personality, grants bonuses to persuasion, bluffing, socializing, etc. A high CHR lets characters smooth talk their way through many situations, gaining followers or discerning another’s motivations/lies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every playable species has a basic statline and maximum stat caps. The caps are 8 higher than the baseline stat score for a creature. For example, a human has 10 base MGT, so 18 is the cap. A goblin by contrast has 7 base MGT and this caps out at 15. Regular creatures and monsters do not deviate from their statlines in the bestiary. Each SPAMFIC stat confer modifiers on actions in a range. Checks use these modifiers when appropriate to represent a character’s aptitude or lack thereof when attempting actions.</p>
    <p>The modifiers are handled in the character sheet, but if you are interested it roughly follows the Dungeons and Dragons system of every pair increasing a modifier by 1, stating at -5 for an stat of 1, then -4 for an stat of 2-3, and so on.</p>
    <p>Basic stats cost 3 Power Points (PP) to increase each rank up to 12, and then 5 each rank after that. Power Points are explained in <a href="char_creation.html">Character Creation.</a></p>
  <h3>Derived Stats</h3>
    <p>Derived from some of the SPAMFIC stats are a few more. Wounds, Action Points, and Encumbrance are all derived from direct stat scores, not stat modifiers. Size is derived from your character’s species.</p>
  <h4>Wounds</h4>
    <p>A character’s Wounds stat broken into several breakpoints based off of their MGT and FOR. Once wounds equal or pass a breakpoint, the character suffers its penalties.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Wounded (FOR):</u> You are injured, but still fit to fight. A -1 penalty on physical actions and initiative.</li>
      <li><u>Very Wounded (MGT/2 + 2*FOR):</u> You are injured, but still fit to fight. A -1 penalty on physical actions and initiative.</li>
      <li><u>Dead (MGT + 3*FOR):</u> You are already dead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Physical actions include attack rolls, damage rolls, spellcasting, and various other interactions, such as performing medicine or climbing.</p>
    <p>Wounds are healed by drinking a Kumak potion (see Alchemy) or otherwise at the rate of 2 every 24 hours after being injured, provided that all bleeding has stopped and treatment was given.</p>
  <h4>Action Points (AP)</h4>
    <p>A character’s AP determines their number of actions per round of combat, based off of their PER and AGI. The max AP for a character is calculated as (PER/4 + AGI/1.5).</p>
  <h4>Willpower (WP)</h4>
    <p>A character’s WP acts as additional action points. WP does not regenerate every round, and can be burned at any time during combat to perform actions that otherwise cost too much AP. Notably, WP is also used as a resource by magic users, in order to cast their spells. The starting WP for a character is calculated as (SPR + CHR/4).</p>
  <h4>Encumbrance</h4>
    <p>A character’s encumbrance represents the weight they can carry long term. Once weight equals or passes a breakpoint, the character suffers its penalties.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Encumbered (1.5*MGT):</u> You are carrying a moderate load. -2 penalty on AGI checks and initiative, and actions cost +1 AP.</li>
      <li><u>Over Encumbered (2.5*MGT):</u> You are carrying a very heavy load. -5 penalty on AGI checks and initiative, and actions cost +2 AP.</li>
      <li><u>Max Encumbrance (3*MGT):</u> You cannot carry more than this value. If you do you are reduced to a stationary state as well as suffering a -8 penalty on AGI checks and initiative, and actions cost +4 AP.</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Guard</h4>
    <p>A character’s Guard represents how able they are to protect themselves from being struck by a solid blow. It is calculated as (PER/2.5 + AGI/2).</p>
