<h1>Skills System</h1>
  <p>Every character has a set of general skills, some of which they are proficient in and some of which they aren't. For a given skill, there are three levels of expertise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Unskilled:</u> The character gains no bonuses.</li>
    <li><u>Skilled:</u> The character gains a +4 bonus.</li>
    <li><u>Expert:</u> The character gains a +6 bonus and Advantage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It costs the same for all skills to upgrade their expertise levels. To become Skilled it costs 4PP, and to become an Expert it costs 10PP.</p>
  <p>A given skill has up to two modifiers. When performing a skill check, a character picks the higher of the modifiers.</p>
