# nextjs notes
- framework for building apps with react
- folder structure:
    - /app: contains all routes, components and logic
    - /app/lib: store reusable functions here for fetching data, processing data, etc.
        - db_types.ts: plan to have database types defined here
    - /app/components: store UI components like tables and cards
    - /public: store static assets like page icons
- the folders are used to create routes on the webapp, each folder needs a `page.tsx` file inside to turn it into a route
    - for example, `/app/page.tsx = /`, and `/app/rulebook/page.tsx = /rulebook`
    - a `layout.tsx` file will apply the given layout to all children of this route
